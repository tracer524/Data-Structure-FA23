Huffman Tree, also known as Huffman Coding, is a popular algorithm used for data compression. Itâ€™s a specific type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process involves creating a binary tree where each node represents a character and its frequency in the data to be encoded. The characters are stored in the leaf nodes, and the path from the root to each leaf node forms the binary code for that character. Characters that occur more frequently have shorter codes, while less frequent characters have longer codes, ensuring optimal data compression.
