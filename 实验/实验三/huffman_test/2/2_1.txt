Data Structures is a fundamental course in computer science that explores how we can organize and store data in a way that enables efficient access and modification. This course typically covers topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, and graphs. Students learn how these structures work, how to implement them, and how to choose the right structure for a specific task. Understanding data structures is crucial for writing efficient code and can be very helpful in problem solving.
